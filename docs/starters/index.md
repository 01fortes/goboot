# Starter Modules

Starters are a powerful feature of GoBoot that allow you to create reusable modules of functionality. They're inspired by Spring Boot's starter concept and make it easy to add new features to your application.

## What is a Starter?

A starter is a module that:

1. Registers one or more components
2. Configures those components based on variables
3. Can be conditionally enabled or disabled

Starters are a way to package up a set of related components so they can be easily reused across applications.

## Types of Starters

GoBoot supports several types of starters:

- [Basic Starters](./basic-starters.md) - Simple starters that register components
- [Conditional Starters](./conditional-starters.md) - Starters that only run if certain conditions are met
- [Composite Starters](./composite-starters.md) - Starters that combine multiple other starters
