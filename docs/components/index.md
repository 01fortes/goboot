# Component System

Components are the fundamental building blocks of a GoBoot application. This section covers everything you need to know about creating and using components.

## Component Types

GoBoot provides several component types for different use cases:

- [Basic Components](./basic-components.md) - Simple components that just need initialization
- [Lifecycle Components](./lifecycle.md) - Components with start and stop phases
- [Background Components](./background-components.md) - Components that run in the background
- [Scheduled Components](./scheduled-components.md) - Components that run on a schedule

## Component Features

Learn about the various features that components provide:

- [Component Lifecycle](./lifecycle.md) - How components are initialized and managed
- [Dependency Injection](./dependency-injection.md) - How components can depend on each other
- [Component Ordering](./ordering.md) - Controlling the order of component initialization

## Common Patterns

Explore common patterns for working with components:

- [Service Components](./service-components.md) - Creating components that provide services
- [Configuration Components](./configuration-components.md) - Components that provide configuration
- [Repository Components](./repository-components.md) - Data access components
